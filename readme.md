## scatterplot with connected paired data points

Scatterplot to compare the data of two groups. All participants give numerical responses to the same set of questions. Points on the graph represent the mean value of the response for each question for each group. The two points for a given question are joint by a line that takes the colour corresponding to the group producing the higher value. Also includes code for some additional comparisons between the two groups.
